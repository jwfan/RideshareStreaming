            In Task 1, you need to read the content in the tracefile we give to you,

            streams based on the value of "type" field in the JSON string.

            Please note that you're working on an ec2 instance, but the streams should
            be sent to your samza cluster. Make sure you can consume the topics on the
            master node of your samza cluster before make a submission.
